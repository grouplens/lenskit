/**
 * LensKit data access objects.
 *
 * <p>LensKit uses <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/DataAccessObject.html">Data Access Objects</a>
 * to obtain access to rating data.  These objects allow LensKit to query for
 * users, items, ratings, etc.
 *
 * <p>Many DAO operations are expected to be fast, usually with appropriate caching.  It is typical
 * for DAOs to be instantiated once per {@link org.lenskit.api.Recommender} (and therefore
 * once per request in a web environment), and to cache aggressively in instance variables.  More
 * sophisticated implementations using shared caches or services such as Memcache are certainly
 * feasible.
 *
 * <p>The streaming DAO implementations build up a cache once per instance.  They aren't really
 * suitable for anything besides recommender evaluation, typically.
 *
 * <p>The data access objects make no transactional or immutability guarantees,
 * and does not provide mutation.  An implementation is, of course, free to
 * provide mutation.
