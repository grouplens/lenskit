/**
 * Configuration loading support.
 * <p>
 * This package provides support for loading {@linkplain
 * org.grouplens.lenskit.core.LenskitConfiguration LensKit configurations} from configuration files
 * written using a Groovy-based DSL.  For example, the following:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // configure the item scorer
 * bind ItemScorer to ItemItemScorer
 * // set up a baseline predictor
 * bind BaselinePredictor to ItemUserMeanPredictor
 * // use the baseline for normalizing user ratings
 * bind UserVectorNormalizer to BaselineSubtractingUserVectorNormalizer
 * // the default neighborhood size is 20, so the next line isn't technically needed
 * set NeighborhoodSize to 20
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * See {@link ConfigHelpers} for entry points to quickly load configurations, and
 * {@link ConfigurationLoader} for more control over the configuration load process.
 * </p>
