/**
 * Base interface for metrics, which are used by evaluations to measure their results.  Metrics may
 * have additional resources backing them, such as extra output files, and therefore must be closed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Metrics use <em>contexts</em> to track and accumulate data for experimental conditions.  For each
 * experimental condition (algorithm / data set pair), the evaluator will do the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a context for the experiment using {@link #createContext(Attributed, TTDataSet, Recommender)}.</li>
 * <li>Measure each test user with {@link #measureUser(TestUser, Object)}, passing in the context
 * in which the user should be evaluated.</li>
 * <li>Output the result of each user measurement to the per-user output table (if active).</li>
 * <li>Obtain the aggregate results from this metric with {@link #getResults(Object)}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The context will general consist of accumulators for the aggregate results reported by a metric
 * over the entire experimental condition, such as the average of all user measurements.  It may
 * also contain additional relevant information, such as anything needed from the algorithm and
 * data set for the measurements, or additional output tables for recording extra data.
 *
 * <p>
 * Metrics themselves are generally stateless, with all state contained in the context.  In this
 * case, there is a single instance of the metric, or an instance per parameterization, and the
 * {@link #close()} method is a no-op.  Some metrics need state or output resources; such metrics
 * should define a {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.eval.traintest.MetricFactory} to instantiate them,
 * and clean up and release resources or state in {@link #close()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Metrics may be used from multiple threads.  LensKit does not currently use multiple threads with
 * the same context, but that may change in the future.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link AbstractMetric} provides a base implementation of this interface that allows user and
 * aggregate measurements to be defined in plan Java objects, so metrics do not need to handle
 * creating table rows themselves.
 *
 * @param <X> The type of accumulator used by this metric.
