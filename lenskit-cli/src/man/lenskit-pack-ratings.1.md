# lenskit-pack-ratings

## Name

**lenskit pack-ratings** - pack rating data into a binary file for efficient access.

## Synopsis

**lenskit** [GLOBAL OPTIONS] **pack-ratings** *OPTIONS*

## Description

The `pack-ratings` command packs rating data into a binary file that LensKit can efficiently map
into memory.  These files make many recommender operations significantly faster and less memory
intensive, including model building and recommendation with certain algorithms.

## Options

--help
:   Show usage help.

-o *FILE*, --output-file *FILE*
:   Write the resulting recommender model to *FILE*.  If not specified, the ratings will be packed
    into the file `ratings.pack`.

--no-timestamps
:   Ignore timestamps in the input data and omit them from the packed ratings.

### Input Data Options

This command can read data in several different ways.  One of the following mutually-exclusive
options must be present:

--ratings-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the delimited text file *FILE*.

--csv-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the CSV file *FILE*.  This is identical to passing `--ratings-file=FILE` with
    `--delimiter=,`.

--tsv-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the tab-separated file *FILE*. This is identical to passing
    `--ratings-file=FILE` with `--delimiter=^I`, but doesn't require you to know how to encode
    tab characters in your shell.

--pack-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the packed rating file *FILE*.  Packed files can be created with the
    [**pack-ratings**](lenskit-pack-ratings.1.html) command.

Additionally, the following options provide additional control over the data input:

-d *DELIM*, --delimiter *DELIM*
:   Use *DELIM* as the delimiter for delimited text files.  Only effective in conjunction with
    `--ratings-file`.

## Known Issues

If you want timestamped data, the input data must be sorted by timestamp.  LensKit will eventually
be able to sort data in the packing process, but cannot currently do so.
