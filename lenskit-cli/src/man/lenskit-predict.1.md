# lenskit-predict

## Name

**lenskit predict** - predict user ratings of items.

## Synopsis

**lenskit** [GLOBAL OPTIONS] **predict** [OPTIONS] *USER* *ITEM*...

## Description

The `predict` command predicts a user's ratings for some items.  It loads a recommender from a
trained model file and/or LensKit configuration scripts and uses the configured algorithm to
produce rating predictions.

## Options

*USER*
:   The user ID for whom to generate predictions.

*ITEM*
:   An item ID to predict for.

--help
:   Show usage help.

-m *FILE*, --model-file *FILE*
:   Load a trained recommender engine from *FILE*.

-c *SCRIPT*, --config-file *SCRIPT*
:   Configure the recommender using *SCRIPT*.  This option can be specified multiple times, and
    later configurations take precedence over earlier ones.  If `--model-file` is also specified,
    the scripts are used to modify the trained model.

--print-channel *CHAN*
:   In addition to rating predictions, also print the value in side channel *CHAN*.

### Input Data Options

This command can read data in several different ways.  To give the rating prediction process some
data to work with, one of the following mutually-exclusive options must be present:

--ratings-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the delimited text file *FILE*.

--csv-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the CSV file *FILE*.  This is identical to passing `--ratings-file=FILE` with
    `--delimiter=,`.

--tsv-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the tab-separated file *FILE*. This is identical to passing
    `--ratings-file=FILE` with `--delimiter=^I`, but doesn't require you to know how to encode
    tab characters in your shell.

--pack-file *FILE*
:   Read ratings from the packed rating file *FILE*.  Packed files can be created with the
    [**pack-ratings**](lenskit-pack-ratings.1.html) command.

Additionally, the following options provide additional control over the data input:

-d *DELIM*, --delimiter *DELIM*
:   Use *DELIM* as the delimiter for delimited text files.  Only effective in conjunction with
    `--ratings-file`.

### Script Environment Options

This command takes the standard LensKit script environment options for controlling how configuration
scripts are interpreted:

-C *URL*, --classpath *URL*
:   Add *URL* (which can be a path to a local directory or JAR file) to the classpath for loading
    the configuration scripts.  This URL can contain additional components for the recommenders.
    This option can be specified multiple times to add multiple locations to the classpath.

-D *PROP*=*VALUE*, --define *PROP*=*VALUE*
:   Define the property *PROP* to equal *VALUE*.  This option is currently ignored for this command.
    To set Java system properties, use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable (see
    [**lenskit**(1)](lenskit.1.html)).
